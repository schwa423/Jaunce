What are our responsibilities for destroying Three.js objects?  Does garbage-collection free the WebGL resource?  How can we immediately free a resource without waiting for garbage-collection?  For example, if we want to vary the resolution that we render a Page at, we might want to change its encapsulated RenderTarget; if we do so, we'll want to free the resources of the old RenderTarget ASAP.
